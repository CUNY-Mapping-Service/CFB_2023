        <h4><img src="img/bmlogo.png" alt="New York City Campaign Finance Board" title="New York City Campaign Finance Board" />&nbsp;&nbsp;About the NYC CFB 2023 Contributions Map</h4>

    <p>The map represents contributions from individuals (including candidates, their spouses, &amp; family members) submitted to the NYC Campaign Finance Board (CFB) by each candidate's campaign, up through and including the latest filing period for the 2023 election cycle.</p>
    <p>The residential addresses provided by the campaigns for these contributions were geocoded by CFB using the Geosupport system from NYC Department of City Planning. Note that if a campaign provided an incorrect address, or an employer's address rather than a home address, the mapped display of contribution patterns will be somewhat different than the actual locations of the contributions. Also, a small number of contributions are omitted from the map due to missing, incomplete, or incorrect street addresses in the original data provided to the Campaign Finance Board.</p>
    <img src="img/CFBinfobox_200w.gif" alt="CFB info box" style="float: right;" />
    <p>Contributions are summed and averaged by ZIP Code, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/nynta_metadata.pdf?r=16b" target="_blank">neighborhood tabulation area</a>, Council district, or election district using geographic boundaries provided by the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page" target="_blank">NYC Department of City Planning</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Zip-Code-Boundaries/i8iw-xf4u" target="_blank">NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications</a>.</p>
    <p>The map page also displays overall net contributions (contributions minus refunds) regardless of geography in an info box separate from the map (<em>example at right</em>). This box displays statistics on contributions from individuals such as percent from within NYC vs outside NYC &amp; share of contributions at $250 or below vs above $250. The info box also displays statistics on contributions from all sources, displaying the share from individuals vs the combined total from political committees, labor unions, businesses, and any other sources.</p>
    <p>The online map application was developed for CFB by the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/urbanresearchmaps" target="_blank">Center for Urban Research at the CUNY Graduate Center</a>.</p>
